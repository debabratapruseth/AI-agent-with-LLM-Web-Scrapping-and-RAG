# Web Insights Agent using LLM, Web Scraping and RAG 

The project demonstrates how to build a scalable and efficient Web Insights Agent using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The agent scrapes a web page and its internal links, stores their content in a FAISS vector store, and uses GPT-4 to answer user questions based on relevant retrieved chunks.

## What You’ll Learn
This project is ideal for beginner to intermediate Python/AI learners and covers:

- Advanced web scraping and internal link handling

- Semantic chunking and embedding with OpenAI

- Vector similarity search using FAISS

- RetrievalQA pipeline with GPT-4 for contextual question answering

- Core RAG concepts in practice

---


## Technologies Used
This solution integrates the following tools:

- requests + BeautifulSoup: Scrape HTML content and recursively visit child/internal links.

- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (LangChain): Chunk large documents into LLM-friendly segments.

- OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002: Create embeddings for each text chunk.

- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Vector database to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.

- LangChain’s RetrievalQA Chain: Combines a retriever (FAISS) with GPT-4 to generate accurate answers.

- GPT-4 / GPT-3.5: LLM engine for answering questions using retrieved web knowledge.

- Google Colab: Notebook-based interface for easy execution and experimentation.

## How It Works
- Input: User provides a question and a target URL.

- Scraping: The code scrapes content from the main URL and child pages (limited to 5–10 by default).

- Chunking & Embedding:

   Content is split into manageable chunks.

   Embeddings are created and stored in FAISS.

- Retrieval + LLM:

   User’s question is converted into an embedding.

   FAISS returns top-k similar chunks.

- GPT-4 is called with those chunks and the user’s question.

- Response: The agent returns a concise, contextually correct answer.

---


## Getting Started
- Clone the repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.

- Set your OpenAI API key (OPENAI_API_KEY).

- Run all cells and try your own questions on any website!

---


## Future Enhancements
- Add persistent FAISS index saving/loading

- Integrate ChromaDB or Pinecone for cloud-scale use

- Build a Streamlit UI for non-technical users

- Add summarization for longer child pages before embedding
